Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
setwd("./data")
unzip(zipfile="repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip")
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv")

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
### 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
totalStepsPerDay <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
##
### 2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(totalStepsPerDay, main=paste("Histogram of Total number of steps taken each day"),xlab="Total number of steps", ylab="Interval")
##
### 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(totalStepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)
median(totalStepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
